Race0.11
========
- Added basic controlling mechanisms
- Will have to incorporate OldMain.py back into execution with controls

Race0.12
========
- Migrated oldMain.py back into Main.py using the new game loop
- Added EventHandler.py to directory
	- Handles event input within the game loop
- Currently have dummy display, need to print level to screen

Race0.13
========
- Main.py game loop processes the Entities/Walls passed via the Level
	- Requires shapes to be added to the Entities for proper drawing
- Added Player.py; functions the same as Racer.py for now
- Entities need to be properly positioned
	- Requires calculating Level coordinates into game world coordinates
- Entity.py added; inheritance to be added for Racer/Player 

Race0.14a
=========
- Added Position.py, Entity.py, ObjectData.py
- ObjectData.py serves as information holder for objects
	- Holds information such as w, h, speed
- Implemented inhieritance using Entity.py
	- Super for Player/Racer
- Need to scale objects to properly display on screen
	- Need to decide on ppm values for display

Race0.14b
=========
- Added PPM values to LevelBuilder.py
  - PPM is passed into objects to be properly scaled when drawn
  - This approach retains the initial level values of GameObjects
	  - Entities contain proper game world positions wrt ppm
- Properly displays objects in game world wrt ppm/pos

Race0.15
======== 
- Changes wrt Entity were required to implement movement
  - The addition of MovementHandler will allow entities that can move the ability to initiate move behavior
- The addition of MovementHandler.py was supposed to be an interface but apparently Python does not have them (?)
  - Further research will be needed to see the best way to implement an interface since a class is not needed
  - However, the current MovementHandler.py will serve as a placeholder
- The addition of MovableEntity.py represents entities that will be able to receive movement behavior
- Changed the structure of Racer.py and Player.py to be created as MovableEntity instead of Entity

Race0.15b
=========
- Further changes made to Entity
  - Inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite now
  - Will allow use with 'Groups' in Main.py wrt Walls/Entities/Other
  - Loads image from .png file 
  - Began work upon update()
    -- handles movement of Entity during frames
- Adjustments made within Main.py and MovableEntity.py as well

Race0.15c
=========
- Images are properly scaled to their dimensions given within ObjectData.py
- MovableEntity.py now supports the variable 'direction'
  - Direction allows entities to direct their movement 
- EventHandler.py handles the rotation of MovableEntity in E and W directions
  - Requires some adjustment to lower the speed
